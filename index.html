            <p>My name is Steven Foster Jr. I am currently a student in the Coding Bootcamp at Univesity of Arizona. I am going through the bootcamp to expand my skillset and transition into a new position at either my current employer or elsewhere. I currently work for Grand Canyon University as an IT Application Administrator for a system based off of Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011. We are in the process of upgrading to Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2016.</p>
            <p>Some of my hobbies include, sports, both playing and watching, travelling, trying new restaurants, and spending time with extended family. I was born and raised in Arizona and I have lived here my entire life, other than 4 months that I lived in North Dakota to play college football. I am a fan of all of the major professional sports teams in Arizona. Even though I rarely can look forward to a championship run.</p>
